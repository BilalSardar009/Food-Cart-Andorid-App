# Food-Cart-Andorid-App

This repository contains the source code for a simple food app that stores details of food prices and allows users to add items to a cart. The app uses Firebase to store data and includes three activities: a products activity, a detail activity, and a cart activity.

# Project Overview
This Android app aims to help users browse and purchase food items from a list of available products. The app includes a products activity that displays a list of food items along with their prices. Users can click on an item to view more details in the detail activity, including a description and an image.

The app also includes a cart activity where users can add items to their cart and view the total price of their order. The user's cart is stored in Firebase and can be accessed from any device with the app installed.
